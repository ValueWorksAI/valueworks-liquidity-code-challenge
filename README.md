# ValueWorks Liquidity Code Challenge

Welcome to our code challenge! This repo contains the frontend code base for the code challenge and the mocked backend (using `json-server`).

In order to run the frontend you need to use
```
npm run dev
```

And to be able to use the mocked backend
```
npx json-server --watch json-server/db.json
```
